This is the practice we will do together during the git concept afternoon.
# Fall - 2022

### Please perform the following tasks (USING COMMAND LINE FOR ALL THE STEPS):

1. Open your email with the GitHub invitation and join this repository "git-concept-fall-2022-practice-template".
2. Clone this Repository to a Local Path on your local machine. 
3. Change the background color of the header and footer elements (.bg-accent) to "#008080" and delete the background-image from the header element in index.html file, then check which file has been changed in this repo.
4. Stage the file you want or all of them and check again how it looks after they are staged.
5. Commit the changes and add a meaningful message about the changes you made.
6. Push your changes to the main.
7. Pull the newest version of the repo and check to see if the changes you made are added. 
8. Now imagine another co-worker on the same project is adding a new "section" to index.html to provide contact information. Discuss the steps in class.
9. If you want to practice more, be that "co-worker"! Make the changes and push them to the repo!
